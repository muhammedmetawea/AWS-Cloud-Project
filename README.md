# AWS Cloud Projects: VPC and IAM

Welcome to the **AWS Cloud Projects** repository! This repository showcases practical implementations of two foundational AWS services:

1. **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: Design and configuration of secure, scalable, and private cloud networks.
2. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Creation and management of secure user permissions and policies.

## Introduction

This repository is designed to help you understand and implement key AWS concepts through hands-on projects focusing on:

- Building secure and scalable networks using **VPC**.
- Managing permissions and access controls using **IAM**.

## Features

### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

- Custom VPC creation with:
  - Public and private subnets.
  - Routing tables and NAT gateways.
  - Security groups and NACL configurations.
- A visual representation of a **VPC Network**:

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- Design and implementation of least privilege access policies.
- Creation of IAM roles for EC2, Lambda, and other AWS services.
- Visual representation of **IAM Architecture**:

## Technologies Used

- **AWS Cloud Services**: VPC, IAM, EC2, Lambda, etc.
- **Terraform** *(optional)*: Infrastructure as code.
- **AWS CLI**: Command-line management of AWS services.
- **Python (Boto3)**: For programmatic automation.
